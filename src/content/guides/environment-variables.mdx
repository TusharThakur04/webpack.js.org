To disambiguate in your `webpack.config.js` between [development](/guides/development) and [production builds](/guides/production) you may use environment variables.

T> webpack's environment variables are different from the [environment variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environment_variable) of operating system shells like `bash` and `CMD.exe`

The webpack command line [environment option](/api/cli/#environment-options) `--env` allows you to pass in as many environment variables as you like. Environment variables will be made accessible in your `webpack.config.js`. For example, `--env production` or `--env goal=local`.

```bash
npx webpack --env goal=local --env production --progress
```

T> Setting up your `env` variable without assignment, `--env production` sets `env.production` to `true` by default. There are also other syntaxes that you can use. See the [webpack CLI](/api/cli/#environment-options) documentation for more information.

There is one change that you will have to make to your webpack config. Typically, `export default` points to the configuration object. To use the `env` variable, you must make `export default` a function:

**webpack.config.js**

```js
import path from "node:path";
import { fileURLToPath } from "node:url";

const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);

export default (env) => {
  // Use env.<YOUR VARIABLE> here:
  console.log("Goal:", env.goal); // 'local'
  console.log("Production:", env.production); // true

  return {
    entry: "./src/index.js",
    output: {
      filename: "bundle.js",
      path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
    },
  };
};
```

T> Webpack CLI offers some [built-in environment variables](/api/cli/#cli-environment-variables) which you can access inside a webpack configuration.
